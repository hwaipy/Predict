MoonTracker 1.0 by KD2BD
========================
MoonTracker is intended to support moonbounce (EME) communications by
calculating the position of the Moon, and sending appropriate control
signals to an AZ/EL antenna rotator.  Once invoked, MoonTracker spawns
itself into the background, and continues to run until terminated by
a kill signal.  If the Moon is not above the horizon when MoonTracker
is invoked, MoonTracker goes to sleep until the predicted time of
Moon rise.

MoonTracker reads ground station location information from PREDICT's
predict.qth file.  Much like PREDICT, MoonTracker recognizes several
command-line options that specify the serial port to be used by the
program.  Simply invoking MoonTracker without any arguments displays
a list of recognized options:


		--==[ MoonTracker v1.0 by KD2BD (c) 2002 ]==--

			    ...Available options...

	-a serial port (/dev/ttyS0) -- sends data as it changes
	-a1 serial port (/dev/ttyS0) -- sends data at one-second intervals
	-q alternate qth file (site.qth)


Use the fodtrack utility to operate MoonTracker with a FODTRACK rotator
control system.  MoonTracker may be safely terminated using the killall
commmand (killall moontracker).

Happy EMEing!
